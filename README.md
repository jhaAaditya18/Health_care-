# Health_care-


— Healthcare Data Analysis & AI System
🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis & AI Modeling

A complete end-to-end healthcare analytics project involving Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and an AI-based Doctor Recommendation System.
This project demonstrates how healthcare data can be leveraged to gain actionable insights, detect abnormalities, classify patient outcomes, and suggest medical actions using data-driven intelligence.

🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a structured analysis of a healthcare dataset containing patient demographics, medical conditions, billing information, and diagnostic results.

The project covers:
✔ Data Loading & Cleaning
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Visualizations & Distribution Analysis
✔ Supervised ML Model (Random Forest Classifier)
✔ Unsupervised Outlier Detection (Isolation Forest)
✔ AI Doctor Recommendation System

🧠 Tasks Included
### 📝 Task 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Load and clean dataset
Check missing values
Show dataset statistics

Visualize:
Age distribution
Billing amount distribution
Gender count
Medical conditions
Generate insights using plots

🤖 Task 2 — Supervised Learning

A Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict patient test results using features like:
Age
Gender
Blood Type
Medical Condition
Admission Type
Billing Amount

Model outputs:
Accuracy score
Classification report
Confusion matrix

🔍 Task 3 — Unsupervised Learning (Anomaly Detection)
Uses Isolation Forest to detect unusual patterns (possible anomalies) in patient billing and health indicators.
Identifies
Outlier patients
Abnormal medical patterns
Billing irregularities

🧑‍⚕️ Task 4 — AI Doctor Recommendation System
A rule-based + pattern-driven system that:
Analyzes medical condition
Checks predicted test results
Suggests doctor specialization
Suggests urgency level (Normal / Medium / High Priority)

Example output:
Recommendation:
- You should consult a Cardiologist.
- Your case is HIGH priority based on model indicators.
